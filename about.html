						<h3>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h3>
	 					<p>My technical skills are mostly self-taught (the most effective way to learn) with guidance from the development teams and tech-savvy individuals I've worked with. I started coding websites by hand about 10 years ago, but in the past couple years I have committed to researching best practices / web standards and expanding my code language knowledge base.</p>
	 					<p>I'm not just technically-oriented though - I also have an eye for design. I excel at using Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign in the planning processes of web design, as well as for creating web graphics and print materials.</p>

	 				<h3>PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE</h3>
	 				<p>I have experience with a handful of different content management platforms, including Drupal 7, Expression Engine, WordPress, and (just recently) Joomla. And once you've tackled the basic CMS principals, it's easy to tackle a new one!</p>
	 				<p>Content management systems go hand in hand with marketing and using a marketing automation system is vital to any successful marketing team. Using both of these platforms to design and create optimized site pages and landing pages is an integral part of generating sales leads and establishing a brand identity. Understanding each piece of the "digital presence" puzzle gives me a uniquely holistic perspective for managing identities in the digital sphere.</p>
