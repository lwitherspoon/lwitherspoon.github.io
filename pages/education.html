    <p>While web development and graphic design are my passions, I am also a graduate of George Mason University's <a href="http://globalaffairs.gmu.edu/programs/la-ma-gloa" target="_blank">Global Affairs Master's program</a> where my concentration and primary area of study was Global Economic Development. I also received my Bachelor of Arts in <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/forlang/" target="_blank">Modern Foreign Languages</a> in which I focused on French and minored in Russian.</p>
