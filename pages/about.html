    <p>Plan and manage all marketing strategies to drive increased website traffic, lead generation, customer engagement and improve digital experience. While managing the website, I initiated and implemented the migration of the static multi-lingual corporate site to the Drupal 7, which included coding a custom Drupal theme using HTML/CSS and PHP, migrating content, and regression testing the site for production. This shortened the content cycle from several weeks to a couple hours.</p>

    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
    <p>I am self-taught (the most effective way to learn, in my opinion) with guidance from the development teams and tech-savvy individuals I've worked with, coupled with online training courses such as <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/" target="_blank">FrontEnd Masters</a>. I started coding websites by hand about 12 years ago, and discovered a genuine passion for it. Once I began my career in front-end development, I committed to learning and adhering to web standards and best practices, as well as constantly staying on top of the latest trends. Programming for the web is like solving logic puzzles - picking up new programming languages is simply a matter of learning a new syntax.</p>
    <p>What sets me apart from the typical front-end developer is my eye for design. Though I prefer working with a team, I'm equally capable of being a one-stop shop and can take a project from design to implementation. I have experience establishing a creative team and our design processes.</p>
