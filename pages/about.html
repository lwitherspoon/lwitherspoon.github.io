    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
    <p>I'm currently enrolled in Virginia Tech's Online Master of Information Technology program, working toward a graduate certificate in Software Development, which focuses on object-oriented design and implementation of software systems (specifically using Java). I also have hands on work experience with C#, though I'm much more comfortable working with Java.</p>
    <p>I originally started coding websites by hand about 12 years ago, and discovered a genuine passion for it. Once I began my career in front-end development, I committed to learning and adhering to web standards and best practices, as well as constantly staying on top of the latest trends. I quickly realized I wanted a more wholistic view of websites and web applications, and have been working towards full-stack development ever since.</p>
    <p>What sets me apart from the typical developer is my eye for design and experience. Being able to step into a user's shoes lets me better predict, design and implement solutions to the hurdles they encounter.</p>
